# key is the identifier of the Experiment in MAGE-ML file

# experimentName - a more meaningful name for MicroArrayExperiment object

# primaryCharacteristic - Samples have a collection of SampleCharacteristics with a type
#                         and value.  One of these is usually the most significant distinction
#                         between samples in the experiment.  Set this to be primaryCharacteristic
#                         and it will appear in the Sample object.  NOTE: this can be a space
#                         separated list, the first type found (in order) will be set.

# primaryCharacteristicDefault - where no value found for primaryCharacteristic set to this
#                                value.  This can be useful for reference samples not
#                                assigned an ontology term.

# materialIdType - by default a CDNAClone/PCRProduct/etc will be created with the name 
#                  assigned to the reporter.  Set this property to search for an alternaite
#                  database id in the associated BioSequence's sequenceDatabases collection.
#                  NOTE that if more than one identifer from the named database is present
#                  one will arbitrarily be assigned.

# sample1/sample2 - so that sample1 and sample2 references in MicroArrayAssay are in a
#                   consistent order, set according to the label applied to each.
#                   e.g. EXP-1.sample1=cy3     EXP-1.sample2=cy5

# pmid - a PubMed id for a paper presenting the experiment.  This will be create a
#        Publication object referenced from the MicroArrayExperiment

E-SMDB-3450.experimentName=Rossi et al, 2005: Compare blood stem cells from young vs old mice
E-SMDB-3450.description= Loss of immune function and an increased incidence of myeloid leukemia are two of the most clinically significant consequences of aging of the hematopoietic system. To better understand the mechanisms underlying hematopoietic aging, we evaluated the cell intrinsic functional and molecular properties of highly purified long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) from young and old mice. We found that LT-HSC aging was accompanied by cell autonomous changes, including increased stem cell self-renewal, differential capacity to generate committed myeloid and lymphoid progenitors, and diminished lymphoid potential. Expression profiling revealed that LT-HSC aging was accompanied by the systemic down-regulation of genes mediating lymphoid specification and function and up-regulation of genes involved in specifying myeloid fate and function. Moreover, LT-HSCs from old mice expressed elevated levels of many genes involved in leukemic transformation. These data support a model in which age-dependent alterations in gene expression at the stem cell level presage downstream developmental potential and thereby contribute to age-dependent immune decline, and perhaps also to the increased incidence of leukemia in the elderly.

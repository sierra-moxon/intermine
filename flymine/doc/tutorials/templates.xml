    <title>Tutorial3: <emphasis>Running template queries</emphasis></title>

    <para>To enable you to quickly and easily carry out a range of
    queries across the data, FlyMine includes a library of predefined
    template queries. A template consists of a predefined query form
    in which certain variables can be changed. The variables are
    constraints (filters) on certain types of data, so that a subset
    of that type of data is defined.</para>

    <para>This tutorial will guide you through running a template
    query.  The template query 'Search for GO annotations for a
    particular gene' will be used as an example.</para>

    <para>Template queries can be accessed in three ways.  1. Each
    'aspects' page has a set of template queries related to that data
    type.  2. Through the 'search templates' feature 3. Through
    certain object details pages (see tutorial3). In this tutorial the
    template query will be accessed through the genomics
    aspect.</para>

    <para>From the FlyMine home page click on 'start a query' to go to
    the main query page.  The main query page shows the
    'aspects'. Aspects provide a 'view' of a particular type of data
    and how this can be linked with other types of data.  Each aspect
    includes a set of template queries which range from simple queries
    involving just that data type to more complex queries which
    integrate data from other aspects.</para>

    <para>Click on the 'Genomics' aspect to go to the genomics aspect
    page.</para>

       <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="templates1.png" />
          </imageobject><textobject><phrase> </phrase></textobject>
        </mediaobject>
    


    <para>Find the 'Related template queries' section and scroll down
    to find the template 'Search for GO annotations for a particular
    gene':</para>

   <para>Clicking on the arrow next to a template query takes you to
    the template query form:</para>


       <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="templates2.png" />
          </imageobject><textobject><phrase> </phrase></textobject>
        </mediaobject>
    


    <para>This template query has two variables which can be changed
     (or left as the default (all template queries have default values
     for all the variables)).  The first variable has a label
     'synonym.value = '.  This means that you can enter any type of
     gene identifier supported by FlyMine (rather than being limited
     to a specific type of identifier).  For D. melanogaster genes,
     therefore, you could enter an FBgn identifier, CG identifier or a
     gene symbol or name.  Change the default value for this variable
     to 'zen'</para>

     <para>The second variable asks for an organism.  The organism is
     specified for this template because a gene symbol or name may be
     used by more than one organism. Notice that the organism can be
     selected from a drop-down list.  Leave the organism name set to
     Drosophila melanogaster.</para>


     <para>At the bottom of the template form are two options: 'View
     Query' and 'View Results'.  The 'View Query' option allows you to
     display the template in the FlyMine query builder.  This option
     enables you to use a template query as a starting point for
     building a modified or more complex query, or to see how a
     certain query may be constructed using the query builder. The
     'View Results' option allows you to just run the template query
     as it is and go directly to the results.</para>

     <para>Press 'View Query' to see this query displayed in the query
     builder:</para>
  
      <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="templates3.png" />
          </imageobject><textobject><phrase> </phrase></textobject>
        </mediaobject>
     
    
     <para>Go back to the template query form and press 'View Results'
     to directly view the results of this query:</para>

       <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="templates4.png" />
          </imageobject><textobject><phrase> </phrase></textobject>
        </mediaobject>

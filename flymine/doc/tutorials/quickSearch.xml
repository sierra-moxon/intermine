    <title>Tutorial1: <emphasis>Browsing FlyMine: Running a quick search</emphasis></title>

    <para>This tutorial will guide you through running a quick
    search. The tutorial will show you how to run a quick search for
    the 'zen' gene.</para>

    <para>The quick search allows you to access all the information
    that is available for a particular database entry and provides a
    good way to browse the database.</para>

    <para>The quick search option is accessed from the main query
    page. (To access the main query page click on 'Start a query' in
    the FlyMine home page).</para>

    <para>Enter the gene symbol 'zen' into the search box and press
    'Search':</para>

        </mediaobject>
    


    <para>Since one item in the database matches the term 'zen', you
    will be taken straight to the 'Object Details' page for the 'zen'
    gene. Navigating the object details page is described in more
    detail in tutorial3</para>

    <para>Wild cards (*) can be added to increase the range of a quick
    search.  Enter 'zen*' into the search box and press 'Search'. This
    time the search term matches several items in the database and a
    summary list of these will be returned as your results. Each
    summary includes a link ('details') to the object details page for
    that item:</para>

#contains only classes that come from more than one source
#for each class contained every source for that class must be listed

# priority for fields declared in superclass are not overridden by different order in subclass
# e.g. identfier and organism always have priority as defined in BioEntity

# For example, to give interpro prioritiy over uniprot for the 'shortName' field of ProteinDomain:
#
ProteinDomain.shortName = interpro, uniprot, *

# To give flybase priority over all other sources for Gene name:
#
# Gene.name = flybase, *


## removed ncbi-gene from project.xml
# Gene.primaryIdentifier = ecogene, ecogene-gene-fasta, pubmed-gene, *
# Gene.secondaryIdentifier = ecogene, ncbi-gene, *
# Gene.name = ecogene, *
# NcRNA.primaryIdentifier = ecogene, ecogene-gene-fasta, pubmed-gene, *
# NcRNA.secondaryIdentifier = ecogene, ncbi-gene, *
# NcRNA.name = ecogene, *

Gene.primaryIdentifier = ecogene, ecogene-gene-fasta, pubmed-gene, *
Gene.secondaryIdentifier = ecogene, *
Gene.name = ecogene, *
NcRNA.primaryIdentifier = ecogene, ecogene-gene-fasta, pubmed-gene, *
NcRNA.secondaryIdentifier = ecogene, *
NcRNA.name = ecogene, *

NAME
    Webservice::InterMine::Simple - A basic InterMine web-service client.

SYNOPSIS
      my $service = get_service("http://www.flymine.org/query/service");
      my $query = $service->new_query;

      $query->add_view("Organism.shortName", "Organism.taxonId");
      $query->add_constraint({path => "Organism.genus", op => "=", value => "Rattus"});

      @rows = $query2->results_table;
      for my $row (@rows) {
        print "name: $row->[0], id: $row->[1]\n";
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This is a basic representation of a query. It can handle
    straight-forward requests and result sets, but for anything more
    complicated, we recommend you look as the more fully featured
    Webservice::InterMine. This is especially true of large data sets, as
    this implementation has the potential to use lots of memory when
    receiving and processing results.

IMPORTED ROUTINES
  get_service(@args)
    Get a service instantiated with the given arguments.

    Arguments:

    *   ($url) - The root-url to the webservice.

    *   ($url, $token) - The root-url, and an authorisation token.

    *   ($url, $username, $password) - The root-url, and a user's login
        information.

    This can also be called as a static method on the package:

      Webservice::InterMine::Simple->get_service(...);

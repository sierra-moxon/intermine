  <para><ulink url="http://www.intermine.org">InterMine</ulink> is a general purpose object-oriented data warehouse system developed as part of FlyMine project. InterMine enables configurable integration of complex data from multiple sources into a single query-optimised object database. </para> 

  <para><ulink url="http://www.flymine.org">FlyMine</ulink> is built using <ulink url="http://www.intermine.org">InterMine</ulink> with primary focus on Drosophila, Anopheles and other insects. The FlyMine model is generated from existing and emerging ontologies and standards (MAGE, SO, PSI and others).</para> 

  <para>StemCellMine adapts the FlyMine system to integrate data sets useful for Stem Cell researchers. </para> 

  <para>A powerful and flexible query interface enables users to perform arbitrary and complex queries across the data either via a web interface or a programming interface. Users are not confined to 'fill-in-the-blanks' query templates or predefined queries. However, simpler access is available via such template queries.</para>

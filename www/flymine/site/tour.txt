<h2>1. What is FlyMine?</h2>

Data in FlyMine...

<h2>2. Starting points</h2>

Webapp philosophy.
<p/>
Quick Search, Bags, Templates, QueryBuilder.

<h2>3. Object details</h2>

<p><b>Run a quick search for the Drosophila gene 'eve'.</b>  You can search for any identifier or symbol for genes, proteins, transcripts and so on.  You can use '*' as a wildcard.</p>

<img alt="[Quick Search]" class="inlinegraphic" src="quick_search.png"/>


<p>A report page for each gene shows information from many data sources in one place.  There are corresponding pages for all objects in FlyMine, use [details] links to browse.  Note that we can add template queries to this page at any time - it only takes a few minutes.  So if you have a suggestion, let us know.</p>

<h2>4. Templates</h2>

<p>
FlyMine includes a library of template queries, each encapsulates a query with simple web form.</p>

<p>
Find template queries or related aspect pages. [aspect image]
</p>

<p>
Or use 'Search Templates' link that searches the titles and descriptions.
</p>

<img alt="[Click Search Templates]" class="inlinegraphic" src="click_search_templates.png"/>

<p><b>Search for templates for 'orthologue' and select the template 'Gene --> Orthologues + GO terms of these orthologues'</b></p>

<img alt="[Select template]" class="inlinegraphic" src="select_template.png"/>


<h2>5. Run a template</h2>

<p>Templates are a simple web form with one or more fields to fill in.  This query takes a particular gene as input and searches for orthologues that that have GO annotation.</p>

<img alt="[Template form]" class="inlinegraphic" src="template_form.png"/>

<p>Here you can enter any identifier and FlyMine will try to find the right gene, even if it is not a primary identifier.  For example for the D. melanogaster gene zen you could enter 'zen', 'CG1046', 'FBgn0004053' or 'zerknullt'.  You could even enter a transcript (CG1046-RA) or protein (ZEN1_DROME) identifier and it would convert it for you.</p>

<b>Click 'Show Results' to run this template with the default value.</b>


<h2>6. Results page</h2>

<p>The results page lets you page through the results, follow links to report pages and export data.

(Do we need to describe results?  Mention where orthologues come from and what main/secondary mean.)</p>

<p>Note the summary buttons [icon] at the top of each column.  Click this to get some summary statistics about the column - for names and identifiers it will tell you how many unique values there are.  Numerical data gives a min, max, mean and standard deviation.</p>

<p><b>Click the summary button for the column 'Orthologue > organism > shortName'</b>  </p>

<p>The table shows the most commonly occurring GO terms applied to orthologues of the original gene.</p>

<p>
You can export results in a number of formats.

<h2>7. Query Builder</h2>

<p><b>Click on 'Query' in the Trail to get back to the template form.</b></p>

<p><b>Now click 'Edit Query' to bring up the QueryBuilder.</b></p>

<p>[click edit query]</p>

<p>The QueryBuilder allows you to edit queries or create new ones.  The pane on the left shows is a view of the data model starting at the class gene and showing all attributes (e.g. name, symbol) and related classes (e.g. organism, proteins).  (FlyMine uses an object based data model - biological types are termed 'classes' and individual entries are termed 'objects'.  For example the 'zen' and 'eve' genes are both objects of the class Gene.</p>

<p>You can click to open related classes and see their attributes.  The [show image] and [constrain image] let you add fields to the output of a query and add contraints (filters).  <b>Scroll to the bottom of the page to see the output list of this query.</b></p>

<p><b>Click the [red cross image] buttons to remove the last three columns from the query - the three that mention GO annotation, no run the query.</b></p>

<p>Now we have run the query to show orthologues of the starting gene whether they have GO annotation or not.  Now if you click the [summary image] button for the column 'Othologue > organism > shortName' it will show you how many orthologues there are in each organism.</p>


<h2>7. Bag Upload</h2>

<p>You can save lists of data (bags) from the results of a query or by uploading lists of identifiers.  Bags can be used to run queries and compared to one another.  A bag details page provides 'widgets' to help analyse the contents of a bag.

<i>Coming soon - we will create globally available bags with, for example, a list of genes identified as transcription factors.</i>

<b>Click on 'bags' in the top menu bar to get to the bag upload page.</b>
</p>
<img alt="[Click bags in the menu bar]" class="inlinegraphic" src="click_bags.png"/>
<p>

FlyMine has a sophisticated bag creation tool that lets you upload lists of identifiers - they can be a mix of identifier types, it will even convert types for you if, for example, you enter a transcript identifier but want to create a bag of genes.
</p>

<p><b>Upload the example bag:</b></p>

<img alt="[Create a new bag]" class="inlinegraphic" src="create_a_bag.png"/>


<h2>8. Bag confirm page</h2>

If some identifiers don't produce exact matches a confirmation page will let you resolve any issues.  Here two genes were found by synonym and a protein identifier from the original list has been converted to the corresponding gene.

<b>Add these and save the bag.</b>

<h2>9. Bag details page</h2>



Templates have run queries on the whole list at once.  For example, from this list of genes we could fetch all the protein sequences or GO annotation.

<h2>10. Use bags in template queries</h2>

We can use the bag we just created to run another template query.  Lets find all the D. pseudoobscura orthologues.

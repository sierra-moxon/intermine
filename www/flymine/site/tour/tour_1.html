<p>FlyMine is a data warehouse that addresses one of the important
challenges of modern biology: how to integrate and make use of the
diversity and volume of current biological data. Its main focus is
genomic and proteomics data for Drosophila, Anopheles and other
insects.</p>

<p>A series of 'aspects' accessed from the home page show the
range of types of data available in FlyMine and provide more detailed
information on the actual data sets and how the data can be
accessed. By integrating such data into one place, it is possible to
construct queries across the different types of data and the FlyMine web
interface allows access to the integrated data at four different
levels - through browsing, running templates, building custom queries
and analysis and use of lists.  Users are able to browse by using the
quick search fascility which provides a report for a particular item
and links to related information. </p> 

<p>For easy access to a range of
queries (from simple to complex) FlyMine includes a library of
template queries.  These are predefined queries that have been
encapsulated as a simple web form and enable users to run queries
without having to learn how to construct them themselves.</p>

<p>For
advanced users, a powerful query builder allows the construction of
custom queries.  </p>

<p>Finally, users can upload lists of data and
immediately get a wealth of information about the contents of the list
through the list analysis page.  In addition all queries can be
executed on lists of data, which can also be saved from the results of
other queries.  Such a list facility also enables queries to be built
up in stages.  </p>

<p>
Queries and lists can be saved between sessions and
shared with other users by creating a personal FlyMine account (know
as MyMine).  All these entry points to FlyMine can be accessed from
the home page (image).

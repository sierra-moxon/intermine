<p>FlyMine is built using InterMine, an open source software package developed as part of the FlyMine project.</p>

<p>InterMine makes it possible to create data warehouses of biological data with a powerful web query tool for very little programming effort. It can be used to build databases from a single data set or by integrating multiple sources of data. Support is provided for several common biological formats and provides a framework for adding your own data. InterMine includes a sophisticated web interface that works 'out of the box' for any data which can be customised from within the interface.</p>

<p>InterMine is already being used in several other projects.  For more information please see <a href="http://trac.flymine.org">InterMine documentation</a> or contact us at <a href="mailto:support [at] flymine.org">support [at] flymine.org</a>.</p>

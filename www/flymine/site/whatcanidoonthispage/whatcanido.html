<h1 id="templates">Templates</h1>

<div id="basics" class="tabset_content">
<h2 class="tabset_label">The basics</h2>

<p> This page shows all public templates, as well as your own (marked
with 'my') - if you are logged in. Templates are predefined queries,
each has a simple form and a description. Clicking on a template will
display the template form allowing you to run or edit the query. </p>

<p><b>We can add templates to this page at any time - it only takes a few
minutes - so if you have a suggestion, let us know!</b></p>

</div>

<div id="searching" class="tabset_content">
<h2 class="tabset_label">Searching Templates</h2>

<p> You can search templates by keywords (eg gene, orthologue,
FlyAtlas). By default, templates from all data categories will be
searched. Optionally, you can restrict your search to a certain data
type. If you are logged in, public templates as well as your own
templates will be searched, by default.</p>

<img alt="[Templates]"  src="templates_search.png"/>

<p> In the example below, only 'My templates' will be searched (not the public ones), and only templates that I have marked as 'My Favourites'. </p>

<img alt="[Templates]"  src="templates_filter.png"/>

</div>


<h1 id="lists">Lists</h1>

<div id="upload" class="tabset_content">
<h2 class="tabset_label">Upload</h2>


<p>FlyMine can operate on lists of data.  Lists can then be analysed
on a list analysis page, or can be used in (template) queries. The
Upload page allows you to create a list yourself. The list can contain
a mix of identifier types (eg symbols, names, organism database id,)
but it cannot contain different object types (eg a list of genes and
proteins is currently not possible).</p>

<p>To create a list, follow these steps:</p> 

<img alt="[Lists]"  src="lists_upload.png"/>



<table class="inlinetable">
<tr>

<td valign="center" width="30%">  

and then click on </td>

<td valign="center" width="60%">
<img alt="[Lists]"  src="lists_upload_create.png"/></td>
</tr> 
</table>

Note that the identifiers must be separated by commas, eg:
<pre>
  eve, zen, Enhancer of zeste, CG32211
</pre>
not:
<pre>
  eve zen Enhancer of zeste CG32211

</pre>
</div>

<div id="view" class="tabset_content">
<h2 class="tabset_label">View</h2>

<p>The View page shows all public lists (name starting with 'PL'), as
well as your own (marked with 'my') - if you are logged in. Clicking
on a List name will show the List analysis page for this list. </p>

<p><b>We can add new public lists at any time - it only takes a few
minutes - so if you have a suggestion, let us know!</b></p>

<img alt="[Lists]"  src="lists_view.png"/>

<p>You can merge lists, subtract lists and find common members between lists.</p>


<p><i>As an example, an intersection of 2 lists is shown:</i></p>


<img alt="[Lists]"  src="lists_view_intersect.png"/>




</div>

<h1 id="tree">The Data Model</h1>


<p>The FlyMine data tree shows all the classes in FlyMine, some of
which do not yet have data associated with them. In this browse mode,
the number on the right shows the number of objects associated with
that class. You can use this page to select a starting class to make
your query.</p>

<img alt="[Tree page]"  src="datamodel.png"/>

<h1 id="customQuery">QueryBuilder</h1>

<div id="basics" class="tabset_content">
<h2 class="tabset_label">The basics</h2>

<p> Advanced users can use a flexible query interface to construct
their own data mining queries. This page gives access to the QueryBuilder. </p>

<img alt="[QueryBuilder page]"  src="querybuilder_select.png"/>


<img alt="[QueryBuilder page]"  src="querybuilder_actions.png"/>

<p>All the queries you have run during this session are also listed
on this page under 'Query History'. Your Query History can also be found
under MyMine.</p>

</div>

<h1 id="data">Data</h1>

<div id="basics" class="tabset_content">
<h2 class="tabset_label">The basics</h2>

<p> The data page gives an overview of all the data in FlyMine as well
as their source. To have a better overview, FlyMine groups data
together in 'data categories'. The icons (or their title) will bring
you to the corresponding data category page, where you can run a
predefined template query, build your own query (see below), and have
access to bulk download. Certain template queries, as well as the
QueryBuilder itself, allow you to perform searches that span more than
one data category.</p>


</div>

</div>

<div id="queryHistory" class="tabset_content"><h2 class="tabset_label">Query History</h2>


<p>All queries that you run are saved in your Query History with the
default name 'query_x' (where x increments for each query run). These
queries will only be saved during the time of the current session. To
save queries permanently and to import queries, you need to be
logged-in. Exporting and saving a query will will not delete it from
your query history during that session.</p>

<img alt="[Mymine Page]"  src="Mymine_history.png"/>


</div>
<div id="savedQueries" class="tabset_content"><h2 class="tabset_label">Saved Queries</h2>


<p>This page lists all queries that you have saved before. They will
be saved permanently. Queries with names identical to existing queries
will get an automatic extension to make it unique,
e.g. dmel-proteins-1, dmel-proteins-2.</p>

<img alt="[Mymine Page]"  src="Mymine_savedqueries.png"/>

</div>
<div id="savedTemplates" class="tabset_content"><h2 class="tabset_label">Saved Templates</h2>

 <p>The 'Saved Templates' page provides a list of all templates that
 you created yourself or have imported. They will be saved
 permanently. Template queries with names identical to existing
 queries will get an automatic extension to make it unique,
 e.g. dmel-proteins-1, dmel-proteins-2.</p>

<h1 id="dataCategories">Data Category Page</h1>

<div id="basics" class="tabset_content">
<h2 class="tabset_label">The basics</h2>


<p>The FlyMine website presents the principle data types grouped
together as different 'data categories', such as protein interactions or gene
expression.</p>

<p><i>As an example, 'the transcriptional regulation' category is shown.</i></p>

<p> Each data category page lists:</p>

    <p>1. <b>Current data</b> - background information on the origin of particular source datasets</p>
    <p>2. <b>Bulk download</b> - access to convenient derivative bulk datasets for browsing or export in standard format:</p>

<img alt="[Aspect Page]"  src="aspect_top.png"/>

    <p>3. Relevant predefined <b>template queries</b>:</p>

<img alt="[Aspect Page]"  src="aspect_templates.png"/>


    <p>4. <b>Query starting points</b> - classes for use as starting points in the Query Builder:</p>

<img alt="[Aspect Page]"  src="aspect_querystart.png"/>

</div>


<h1 id="reportPage">Report Page</h1>

<div id="basics" class="tabset_content">
<h2 class="tabset_label">The basics</h2>

<p>For every object in the FlyMine database there is a report page
which provides all the data that Flymine has available for that object
along with additional information such as the GBrowse genome viewer
for sequence features.</p>


<p>All report pages have the same basic structure: The top part
provides <b>summary information</b> for every object, whereas the lower part,
<b>Further Information by category</b> has more detailed information
divided into different data types or categories</p>

<p><i>As an example the report page for the </i>even-skipped<i> gene is shown.</i></p>

<img alt="[Report Page]"  src="report_top.png"/>

<p> Template queries are run for this object when the page is loaded. We
can add templates to this page at any time - it only takes a few
minutes - so if you have a suggestion, let us know.  </p>

<img alt="[Report Page]"  src="report_bottom.png"/>

</div>

<h1 id="template">The Template Form</h1>

<div id="basics" class="tabset_content">
<h2 class="tabset_label">The basics</h2>

<p><i>As an example, the form is shown for the template 'Gene --&gt;
Orthologues + GO terms of these orthologues'</i>. This template takes a
particular gene as input and searches for orthologues that have GO
annotation.-</p>


<p>You can leave the box with the default value shown or you can enter
any identifier and FlyMine will try to find the right gene. For
example, for the <i>D. melanogaster</i> gene zen you can enter 'zen',
'CG1046', 'FBgn0004053', 'zerknullt' or any synonym.  You can even
enter a transcript (CG1046-RA) or protein (ZEN1_DROME) identifier and
FlyMine will convert it for you. Alternatively, you can leave the
default value.</p>

<p>
<img  alt="[Template form]"  src="templform.png"/>
</p>

<p><b>OR</b></p> 

<p>Any variable (box) in a template query can be constrained to a list
(or 'not in' a list) rather than to a single value, provided you have a
list of the correct type saved in 'MyMine'. To constrain a query to a
list, select the checkbox underneath the variable box and choose the
list from the drop-down list.</p>

<h1 id="results">Results Page</h1>

<div id="basics" class="tabset_content">
<h2 class="tabset_label">The basics</h2>


<p> The results for the template 'Gene --&gt; Orthologues + GO
    terms of these orthologues' shows the starting gene, orthologous
    genes and organism names with details of each GO term applied to
    the orthologous genes. Orthologue data in FlyMine come from <a
    href="http://inparanoid.sbc.su.se/">InParanoid</a>. Note that
    'main' means the best hit in the other organism, 'secondary'
    denotes paralogues of the best hit.</p>

<p>
<img alt="[Results Page]"  src="results.png"/>
</p>

<p><b>Summary buttons</b> <img alt="[icon]" src="sigma.png"
valign="center"/> at the top of each column allow you to view some
summary statistics. For names and identifiers it will tell you about
unique values, numerical data gives the min, max, mean and standard
deviation. In case of the example abobe, the summary button for the
column 'Orthologue > GO annotation > name' shows you the most commonly
occurring GO terms applied to orthologues of the original gene. (Note:
it only shows the first 10 rows of summary).</p>


<p>
<img alt="[Results Page]"  src="results_summary.png"/>
</p>


</div>


<div id="export" class="tabset_content">
<h2 class="tabset_label">Exporting and saving results</h2>

<p> - All results pages have a number of <b>export options</b>:</p>

<p>
<img alt="[Results Page]"  src="results_export.png"/>
</p>


<p>Currently, either the entire results table or specific columns can be
exported. If nothing is selected, the entire data set will be
exported. If you do not wish to export certain columns these can be
hidden using the small double arrow in the column header.</p>

<p>
<img alt="[Results Page]"  src="results_select_export.png"/>
</p>

<p> If the results table contains a column with objects that have a
nucleotide or amino acid sequence, it is possible to export all
sequences from that column in FASTA format. Currently, the FASTA
export option will export the sequences belonging to objects in the
first visible (i.e. not hidden) column only. Columns can be moved to
the first position by using the arrows in the header. If objects
appear more than once in the column, the sequence will only be
exported once.</p>


<p> - Results pages also allow you to <b>save your data to a new list or
add them to an existing list</b>:</p>

<p>
<img alt="[Results Page]"  src="results_list.png"/>
</p>


<p>Select the required data and either add it to an existing list or
save it to a new list. Selecting the check boxes next to the column
headings will select the entire column for saving. Alternatively,
individual items can be saved by selecting check-boxes next to the
items. Currently, a list can only contain one column. However, if you
have multiple columns for the same item (eg a column for gene
identifier and one for gene symbol), all related columns become
highlighted when you select the checkbox next to one. This is because
you are saving the actual item (eg the gene) to a list, not just the
identifier.</p>

<h1 id="listAnalysis">List Analysis Page</h1>

<div id="basics" class="tabset_content">
<h2 class="tabset_label">The basics</h2>

<p>A list analysis page provides the following information:</p>
   
<p>1. List contents: A table summarising the contents of your
list. Only up to ten items are shown. You can enter a description for
your list, which might be useful if you want to use your list again at
a later point.</p>

<img alt="[List Analysis Page]" src="listpage_list.png"/>.

<p>2. Links to actions you can do with your list:</p>

<img alt="[List Analysis Page]" src="listpage_actions.png"/>.
   
<p>2. Widgets: Widgets provide additional information about the
contents of your list. Widgets are currently only available for lists
of genes. The types of data shown through widgets will increase in
future releases of FlyMine.</p>


<img alt="[List Analysis Page]" src="listpage_widgets.png"/>.
  
<p>3. Templates: A set of template queries which have been
automatically run on all the items in your list. </p>

</div>

<h1 id="buildList">List confirm page</h1>

<div id="basics" class="tabset_content">
<h2 class="tabset_label">The basics</h2>

<p>The list that you upload is checked against the FlyMine database to
ensure that everything in your list can be found in FlyMine. 


<p>In the example, only 22 out of 28 items were immediately recognized and added to the new list:</p>

<img alt="[List Confirm Page]" src="listconfirm_.png"/>


<p>Any discrepancies are reported as follows:<p>

<p>1. <b>Low quality matches</b>: These are items in your list that do not
match a key (main) identifier in FlyMine but were found as
synonyms. This may mean you have a secondary (old) identifier or are
using a gene symbol that is not the official symbol for that gene. If
you are happy that the item identified is the correct one, you can add
it to your list by clicking on 'Add' in the last column.</p>

<p>2. <b>Duplicates</b>: These are items in your list that match more than
one entry in the database.</p>

 <p>3. <b>Converted types</b>: These are items in your list that matched
 something in FlyMine, but not of the type you selected. (For example,
 if you selected type=gene, but had a protein identifier in your
 list). FlyMine can convert these into the type you selected so that
 you can add the item to your list - click on 'Add' in the last column.</p>


 <p>4. <b>Unresolved identifiers</b>: These are items in your list that were
 either not found in FlyMine, could not be converted to the type you
 selected or matched objects from an organism other than the one you
 selected.</p>

<p><i>An example of Duplicated items is shown below.</i></p>

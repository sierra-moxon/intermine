<h1 id="start">Tutorial 2: Building a template query.</h1>

      <p><i>This tutorial introduces the use of the QueryBuilder to build
      a query. It will then show you how to save this query as a
      template.</i></p>

    <p>You can use the QueryBuilder:/p>

      <ul>
        <li><p>to construct your own data mining queries
      across the multiple integrated data sources,</p></li>

        <li><p>to modify existing template queries or</p></li>

        <li><p>to create your own template queries.</p></li>
      </ul>

      <p>The QueryBuilder interface enables you to browse through
    classes and fields of the data model, selecting those that you
    wish to constrain and those that you wish to include in your
    results.</p>

      <p>Building a query invloves three main steps:</p>

       <ul>
        <li><p>Browsing the model browser to find the classes of data you wish to query.</p></li>
        <li><p>Applying constraints to this data to define the subset of that type of data required</p></li>
        <li><p>Defining your results table by selecting the fields you want to include.</p></li>  

      <p>The main FlyMine QueryBuilder page is composed of several sections:</p>

       <img alt="[querybuilder_overview.png]" class="inlinegraphic" src="querybuilder_overview.png"/> 
        

      <ul> <li><p><b>The model browser (left)</b> allows you to browse
        through the FlyMine data model.  This displays an initial
        starting class and its fields with classes containing related
        information listed below.  Each class can be expanded to show
        the fields for that class and in turn, any classes related to
        that class.  For example, if the starting class is 'Gene', the
        fields shown will include 'name', 'identifier' and 'symbol'
        and the classes of related information include 'Proteins',
        'Transcripts' and 'Microarray results'.  The model browser
        thus allows you to browse through the types of data that are
        available and select those that you wish to query. For each
        field within the model browser there is a 'SHOW' and a
        'CONSTRAIN' option. These are used to either select a field to
        show in the results output or to constrain in the constraints
        list (see below).  </p></li>

       <img alt="[querybuilder_modelbrowser.png ]" class="inlinegraphic" src="querybuilder_modelbrowser.png"/>
     


        <li><p><b>The constraints list (right)</b> allows you to
      specify the constraints you wish to apply to particular classes
      and fields. A constraint is like a filter - you filter out a
      subset of the objects in a class which have certain
      characteristics (defined by the constraint). To apply a
      constraint to a field, navigate to the field in the model
      browser and click on the 'constrain' button next to it. This
      will add the field to the constraints list and bring up a box in
      which you specify your constraint.  You can change the
      relationship (and, or, grouping) between the different
      constraints using the 'constraint logic'.</p></li>

      <img alt="[querybuilder_constrain.png]" class="inlinegraphic" src="querybuilder_constrain.png"/>
      

        <li><p><b>The output fields list (bottom)</b> displays the
        fields you have selected to show in your results.  (Each field
        is represented by a box which will become a column in the
        results table, Initially, the output fields list will say 'No
        fields selected for output').  To select a field to show in
        the results output you press 'SHOW' next to the
        field. (Alternatively selecting 'SUMMARY' next to the class
        name will add the main fields for that class to your results
        output). The order of fields in the output fields list can be
        changed by dragging and dropping them. Fields can be deleted
        from the output fields list using the 'x'. Fields that have
        been selected for output will appear in a blue box in the
        model browser and constraint list.  By default results will be
        sorted alphabetically, in ascending order, based on the first
        column.  The column to sort on can be changed by clicking on
        the 'sort' box under the column name - note this changes the
        name of the column displayed under 'Sort Results By Column' .
        The direction of sorting (ascending/descending) can be changed
        by clicking on the box under the field name in this
        section.</p></li>

    </ul>

      <p>This tutorial introduces the use of the Query Builder to
      alter an existing template. We will start with the template 'For
      the following gene symbol, show its gene identifier' and alter
      it to collect all gene identifiers from genes on the 4th
      chromosome of D. melanogaster.</p>

      <p>Find the template 'Gene symbol --> Gene identifier'
        and run the query for the default Drosophila gene.</p>

       <p>Change the query so that it also gives you the
FBgn number.</p>  


   <ul><li><p>Click on 'Query' in the trail (near top of results page)
to return to the template query form.  Here, click on 'Edit Query' to
display this query in the Query Builder.  - Note that 'identifier' and
'symbol' in the left column have a blue background to indicate that
they are selected for output.</p></li>

  <li><p>To make the FBgn number appear on the result page as well,
click on 'SHOW' next to 'organismDbId' under 'Gene'. 'organismDbId'
will now appear in blue and can be found in the output section
below. The order of the columns can be changed by clicking and
dragging the output boxes.</p></li>

  <li><p>Scroll down and click 'Show results' to run the query again.</p></li>
</ul>

      <p>Change the query again to retrieve all genes on the 4th
      chromosome of D. melanogaster.</p>


   <ul><li><p>Click on 'query' in the trail to return to the Query
   Builder.  The right hand side summarises constraints in the current
   query.  Note the constraint on Gene symbol is 'zen'. Clicking on
   the red cross next to 'symbol' will delete this
   constraint.</p></li>

<p><li>To constrain the current query to D. melanogaster, click on the
'+' sign next to organism in the column on the left. Click on
'CONSTRAIN' next to 'name' (under 'organism). This brings up a
'Constrain' section to the right (you might have to scroll down to
view it). Select 'Filter query results on this field having a specific
value' and choose Drosophila melanogaster from the drop-down menu.
Click 'Add to query' next to the drop-down menu.  </p> </li>


<p><li>Next , constrain the current query for genes on the 4th
chromosome, by clicking on 'CONSTRAIN' next to 'identifier' under
'chromosome'. In the 'Constrain' section to the right, enter a value
for the chromosomal identifier: the identifier for the 4th chromosome
is '4'. Click 'Add to query' next to the drop-down menu.  - Scroll
down and click 'Show results' to run the query. How many genes did you
find?  </p></li>

</ul>


<p>Re-run the query with the results sorted Z-A on the organismDbId (FBgn)</p>

     

      <img alt="[QB_template2.png]" class="inlinegraphic" src="QB_template2.png"/>

      <ul>
        <li><p>Now we need to constrain the query to return
         only genes from <i>D. melanogaster</i>. Click
         on the + sign next to 'organism' in the column on the
         left. Next, click on 'CONSTRAIN' next to 'name' (under
         'organism'). This brings up a 'Constrain' section to the
         right. Select 'Drosophila melanogaster' and click on 'Add to
         query' next to the drop-down menu.</p>
</li>
        <li><p>Finally, we will change the current query so
         that it also returns the FBgn number. To make the FBgn number
         appear on the result page, click on 'SHOW' next to
         'organismDbId' under 'Gene'. 'organismDbId' will now appear
         in blue and can be find in the output section below. The
         order of the columns can be changed by clicking and dragging
         the output boxes. Scroll down and click 'Show results' to run
         the query again.</p>
</li>
      </ul>

      <img alt="[QB-template3.png]" class="inlinegraphic" src="QB-template3.png"/>

      <p>To build a new query from scratch, access the FlyMine
    QueryBuilder at the bottom of the FlyMine home page or by choosing
    a query starting point at the bottom of a dta category page.</p>


      <p>Any query that has been built using the FlyMine QueryBuilder
    can be saved as a template query, as long as it includes at least
    one editable constraint. In order to build a template you need to
    be logged-in to FlyMine. Templates that you create yourself are
    saved to your 'MyMine'.</p>

    <p> After building the query 'Show all genes on the 4th chromosome
    of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>' while being logged-in, scroll
    down and click on 'Start building a template query'.</p>

      <img alt="[buildtemp-start.png]" class="inlinegraphic" src="buildtemp-start.png"/>

      <p>In order to save a query as a template it is necessary to
        define which of the constraints in the query will be editable
        in the template (there must be at least one 'editable'
        constraint in the query). To make a constraint editable
        within a template, click on the lock next to the constraint: A
        field with 'Template constraint settings' will appear in the
        right column. Click in the tick-box next to 'Editable'. At the
        same time, it is possible to add a label to the editable
        constraint (optional) to clarify what it is by typing in a
        label in 'Constraint label'. Click on the 'Update' button in
        this field. The label will appear on the template page after
        creating the template (see below).</p>

      <img alt="[buildtemp-edit.png]" class="inlinegraphic" src="buildtemp-edit.png"/>

      <p>An editable constraint will have an open lock in the
   constraint list, whereas the lock of a constraint that cannot be
   edited will appear locked. The label of the editable constraint
   will appear below the constraint, in italics.</p>

      <img alt="[buildtemp-label.png]" class="inlinegraphic" src="buildtemp-label.png"/>

      <p>If no label was added after a constraint was made editable,
    'no label' will appear under the constraint. Clicking on 'no
    label' allows you to add a label. Click on 'Update' to implement
    the change.</p>

      <img alt="[buildtemp-nolabel.png]" class="inlinegraphic" src="buildtemp-nolabel.png"/>

      <p>Each new template requires a name and a description. The
    description will appear on the template page and in your list of
    template queries, after creating the template (see
    below). Therefore, it should provide as much information as
    possible about what the template will do. Moreover, it should be
    distinguishable from other template queries. After filling the
    'Name' and 'Description' boxes, click on 'Update settings' below
    the boxes.</p>

      <img alt="[buildtemp-name.png]" class="inlinegraphic" src="buildtemp-name.png"/>

      <p>Before creating a template, preview the template and make
    any changes, if necessary. To save this query as a template, click
    on 'Save template'.</p>

      <img alt="[buildtemp-preview.png]" class="inlinegraphic" src="buildtemp-preview.png"/>

      <p>You will be able to view and run this template from the
    'Saved templates' tab of your 'MyMine'. Access your MyMine page
    via the top menu bar on every FlyMine page.  For each template
    there are a set of actions, 'Run', 'Edit' and 'Export'. 'Run' will
    run the template query and give you a results paage.  'Edit'
    allows you to edit the template query. 'Export' will export the
    template in xml format.  In addition clicking on the star next to
    a template name (so that it turns yellow) will add that template
    to the 'Favourite templates' tab of your MyMine.</p>

      <img alt="[buildtemp-history.png]" class="inlinegraphic" src="buildtemp-history.png"/>

      <p>- The template page can be viewed and run from the 'Saved
    Templates' tab of your MyMine page.</p>

      <img alt="[buildtemp-template.png]" class="inlinegraphic" src="buildtemp-template.png"/>

      <p style="">- The template can be exported in xml format.</p>

      <img alt="[buildtemp-export.png]" class="inlinegraphic" src="buildtemp-export.png"/>

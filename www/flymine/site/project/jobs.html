<h2>Software Developer</h2>
<p><b>Salary: £25,134-£32,796 pa</b></p>

<p><i>The funds for this post are available until 31 December 2008 in the first instance and the post may, subject to availability of further funding, be renewed for a further period or periods.</i></p>

<p>We are looking for a software developer to join a Wellcome Trust funded project applying innovative software engineering to the integration of biological data.</p>

<p>FlyMine is a data warehouse of functional genomics data from the model organisms Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) and Anopheles gambiae (mosquito) made available on the Web. <a href="http://trac.flymine.org">InterMine</a> is a data model independent, object-based data integration and query system built to enable <a href="http://www.flymine.org">FlyMine</a> and now also used for other projects. It has a sophisticated Struts/JSP Web interface that allows users to build and run complex queries and analyse lists of data. We work with Java in a Unix/Linux environment and use the PostgreSQL database. All of our code is freely available under an open source licence.</p>

<p>You should hold a degree (or equivalent) in Computing, Science, Engineering or a related discipline. You will have at least two years professional experience working on significant software projects. You must have experience with Java and relational databases. Experience with data modelling and ontologies would be an advantage as would any background working with biological data.</p>

<p>You will work in a team of five software developers using agile development methods. The team is responsible for designing, coding, testing and importing data into the system, many parts of which aretechnically challenging. You will be involved in all aspects of the project and have the opportunity to work with Java, relational databases, object/relational mapping, web services (REST), Perl, Struts/JSP web applications, Ajax and JavaScript.</p>
